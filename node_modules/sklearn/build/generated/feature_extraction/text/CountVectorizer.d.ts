/**
  Convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.

  This implementation produces a sparse representation of the counts using scipy.sparse.csr\_matrix.

  If you do not provide an a-priori dictionary and you do not use an analyzer that does some kind of feature selection then the number of features will be equal to the vocabulary size found by analyzing the data.

  For an efficiency comparision of the different feature extractors, see [FeatureHasher and DictVectorizer Comparison](../../auto_examples/text/plot_hashing_vs_dict_vectorizer.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-text-plot-hashing-vs-dict-vectorizer-py).
