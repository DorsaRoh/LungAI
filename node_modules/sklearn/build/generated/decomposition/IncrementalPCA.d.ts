/**
  Incremental principal components analysis (IPCA).

  Linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition of the data, keeping only the most significant singular vectors to project the data to a lower dimensional space. The input data is centered but not scaled for each feature before applying the SVD.

  Depending on the size of the input data, this algorithm can be much more memory efficient than a PCA, and allows sparse input.

  This algorithm has constant memory complexity, on the order of `batch\_size \* n\_features`, enabling use of np.memmap files without loading the entire file into memory. For sparse matrices, the input is converted to dense in batches (in order to be able to subtract the mean) which avoids storing the entire dense matrix at any one time.

  The computational overhead of each SVD is `O(batch\_size \* n\_features \*\* 2)`, but only 2 \* batch\_size samples remain in memory at a time. There will be `n\_samples / batch\_size` SVD computations to get the principal components, versus 1 large SVD of complexity `O(n\_samples \* n\_features \*\* 2)` for PCA.
