/**
  Gaussian process classification (GPC) based on Laplace approximation.

  The implementation is based on Algorithm 3.1, 3.2, and 5.1 from [\[RW2006\]](#r2da648a61a73-rw2006).

  Internally, the Laplace approximation is used for approximating the non-Gaussian posterior by a Gaussian.

  Currently, the implementation is restricted to using the logistic link function. For multi-class classification, several binary one-versus rest classifiers are fitted. Note that this class thus does not implement a true multi-class Laplace approximation.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../gaussian_process.html#gaussian-process).
