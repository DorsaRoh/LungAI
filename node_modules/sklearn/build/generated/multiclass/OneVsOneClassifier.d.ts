/**
  One-vs-one multiclass strategy.

  This strategy consists in fitting one classifier per class pair. At prediction time, the class which received the most votes is selected. Since it requires to fit `n\_classes \* (n\_classes \- 1) / 2` classifiers, this method is usually slower than one-vs-the-rest, due to its O(n\_classes^2) complexity. However, this method may be advantageous for algorithms such as kernel algorithms which don’t scale well with `n\_samples`. This is because each individual learning problem only involves a small subset of the data whereas, with one-vs-the-rest, the complete dataset is used `n\_classes` times.
