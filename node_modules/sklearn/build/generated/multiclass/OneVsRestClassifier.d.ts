/**
  One-vs-the-rest (OvR) multiclass strategy.

  Also known as one-vs-all, this strategy consists in fitting one classifier per class. For each classifier, the class is fitted against all the other classes. In addition to its computational efficiency (only `n\_classes` classifiers are needed), one advantage of this approach is its interpretability. Since each class is represented by one and one classifier only, it is possible to gain knowledge about the class by inspecting its corresponding classifier. This is the most commonly used strategy for multiclass classification and is a fair default choice.

  OneVsRestClassifier can also be used for multilabel classification. To use this feature, provide an indicator matrix for the target `y` when calling `.fit`. In other words, the target labels should be formatted as a 2D binary (0/1) matrix, where \[i, j\] == 1 indicates the presence of label j in sample i. This estimator uses the binary relevance method to perform multilabel classification, which involves training one binary classifier independently for each label.
