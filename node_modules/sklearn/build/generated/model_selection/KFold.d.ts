/**
  K-Folds cross-validator

  Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets. Split dataset into k consecutive folds (without shuffling by default).

  Each fold is then used once as a validation while the k - 1 remaining folds form the training set.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../cross_validation.html#k-fold).

  For visualisation of cross-validation behaviour and comparison between common scikit-learn split methods refer to [Visualizing cross-validation behavior in scikit-learn](../../auto_examples/model_selection/plot_cv_indices.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-cv-indices-py)
