/**
  Leave-P-Out cross-validator

  Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets. This results in testing on all distinct samples of size p, while the remaining n - p samples form the training set in each iteration.

  Note: `LeavePOut(p)` is NOT equivalent to `KFold(n\_splits=n\_samples // p)` which creates non-overlapping test sets.

  Due to the high number of iterations which grows combinatorically with the number of samples this cross-validation method can be very costly. For large datasets one should favor [`KFold`](sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html#sklearn.model_selection.KFold "sklearn.model_selection.KFold"), [`StratifiedKFold`](sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html#sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold "sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold") or [`ShuffleSplit`](sklearn.model_selection.ShuffleSplit.html#sklearn.model_selection.ShuffleSplit "sklearn.model_selection.ShuffleSplit").

  Read more in the [User Guide](../cross_validation.html#leave-p-out).
