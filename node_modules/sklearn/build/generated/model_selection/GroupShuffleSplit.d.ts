/**
  Shuffle-Group(s)-Out cross-validation iterator

  Provides randomized train/test indices to split data according to a third-party provided group. This group information can be used to encode arbitrary domain specific stratifications of the samples as integers.

  For instance the groups could be the year of collection of the samples and thus allow for cross-validation against time-based splits.

  The difference between LeavePGroupsOut and GroupShuffleSplit is that the former generates splits using all subsets of size `p` unique groups, whereas GroupShuffleSplit generates a user-determined number of random test splits, each with a user-determined fraction of unique groups.

  For example, a less computationally intensive alternative to `LeavePGroupsOut(p=10)` would be `GroupShuffleSplit(test\_size=10, n\_splits=100)`.

  Note: The parameters `test\_size` and `train\_size` refer to groups, and not to samples, as in ShuffleSplit.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../cross_validation.html#group-shuffle-split).
