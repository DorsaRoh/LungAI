/**
  Time Series cross-validator

  Provides train/test indices to split time series data samples that are observed at fixed time intervals, in train/test sets. In each split, test indices must be higher than before, and thus shuffling in cross validator is inappropriate.

  This cross-validation object is a variation of [`KFold`](sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html#sklearn.model_selection.KFold "sklearn.model_selection.KFold"). In the kth split, it returns first k folds as train set and the (k+1)th fold as test set.

  Note that unlike standard cross-validation methods, successive training sets are supersets of those that come before them.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../cross_validation.html#time-series-split).

  For visualisation of cross-validation behaviour and comparison between common scikit-learn split methods refer to [Visualizing cross-validation behavior in scikit-learn](../../auto_examples/model_selection/plot_cv_indices.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-cv-indices-py)
