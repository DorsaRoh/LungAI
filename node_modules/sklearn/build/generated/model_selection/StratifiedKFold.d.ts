/**
  Stratified K-Folds cross-validator.

  Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets.

  This cross-validation object is a variation of KFold that returns stratified folds. The folds are made by preserving the percentage of samples for each class.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../cross_validation.html#stratified-k-fold).

  For visualisation of cross-validation behaviour and comparison between common scikit-learn split methods refer to [Visualizing cross-validation behavior in scikit-learn](../../auto_examples/model_selection/plot_cv_indices.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-cv-indices-py)
