/**
  Random permutation cross-validator

  Yields indices to split data into training and test sets.

  Note: contrary to other cross-validation strategies, random splits do not guarantee that all folds will be different, although this is still very likely for sizeable datasets.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../cross_validation.html#shufflesplit).

  For visualisation of cross-validation behaviour and comparison between common scikit-learn split methods refer to [Visualizing cross-validation behavior in scikit-learn](../../auto_examples/model_selection/plot_cv_indices.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-cv-indices-py)
