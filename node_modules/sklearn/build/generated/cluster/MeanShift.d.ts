/**
  Mean shift clustering using a flat kernel.

  Mean shift clustering aims to discover “blobs” in a smooth density of samples. It is a centroid-based algorithm, which works by updating candidates for centroids to be the mean of the points within a given region. These candidates are then filtered in a post-processing stage to eliminate near-duplicates to form the final set of centroids.

  Seeding is performed using a binning technique for scalability.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../clustering.html#mean-shift).
