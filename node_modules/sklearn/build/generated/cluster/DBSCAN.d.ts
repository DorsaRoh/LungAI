  Perform DBSCAN clustering from vector array or distance matrix.

  DBSCAN - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. Finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them. Good for data which contains clusters of similar density.

  The worst case memory complexity of DBSCAN is \\(O({n}^2)\\), which can occur when the `eps` param is large and `min\_samples` is low.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../clustering.html#dbscan).
