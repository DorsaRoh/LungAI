/**
  Estimate clustering structure from vector array.

  OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure), closely related to DBSCAN, finds core sample of high density and expands clusters from them [\[1\]](#r2c55e37003fe-1). Unlike DBSCAN, keeps cluster hierarchy for a variable neighborhood radius. Better suited for usage on large datasets than the current sklearn implementation of DBSCAN.

  Clusters are then extracted using a DBSCAN-like method (cluster\_method = ‘dbscan’) or an automatic technique proposed in [\[1\]](#r2c55e37003fe-1) (cluster\_method = ‘xi’).

  This implementation deviates from the original OPTICS by first performing k-nearest-neighborhood searches on all points to identify core sizes, then computing only the distances to unprocessed points when constructing the cluster order. Note that we do not employ a heap to manage the expansion candidates, so the time complexity will be O(n^2).

  Read more in the [User Guide](../clustering.html#optics).
