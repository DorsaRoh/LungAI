/**
  Linear Support Vector Regression.

  Similar to SVR with parameter kernel=’linear’, but implemented in terms of liblinear rather than libsvm, so it has more flexibility in the choice of penalties and loss functions and should scale better to large numbers of samples.

  The main differences between [`LinearSVR`](#sklearn.svm.LinearSVR "sklearn.svm.LinearSVR") and [`SVR`](sklearn.svm.SVR.html#sklearn.svm.SVR "sklearn.svm.SVR") lie in the loss function used by default, and in the handling of intercept regularization between those two implementations.

  This class supports both dense and sparse input.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../svm.html#svm-regression).

Then, the weights become `\[w\_x\_1, ..., w\_x\_n, w\_intercept\*intercept\_scaling\]`, where `w\_x\_1, ..., w\_x\_n` represent the feature weights and the intercept weight is scaled by `intercept\_scaling`.
