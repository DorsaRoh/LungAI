/**
  L2-regularized linear regression model that is robust to outliers.

  The Huber Regressor optimizes the squared loss for the samples where `|(y \- Xw \- c) / sigma| < epsilon` and the absolute loss for the samples where `|(y \- Xw \- c) / sigma| > epsilon`, where the model coefficients `w`, the intercept `c` and the scale `sigma` are parameters to be optimized. The parameter sigma makes sure that if y is scaled up or down by a certain factor, one does not need to rescale epsilon to achieve the same robustness. Note that this does not take into account the fact that the different features of X may be of different scales.

  The Huber loss function has the advantage of not being heavily influenced by the outliers while not completely ignoring their effect.
