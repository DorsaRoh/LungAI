/**
  Theil-Sen Estimator: robust multivariate regression model.

  The algorithm calculates least square solutions on subsets with size n\_subsamples of the samples in X. Any value of n\_subsamples between the number of features and samples leads to an estimator with a compromise between robustness and efficiency. Since the number of least square solutions is “n\_samples choose n\_subsamples”, it can be extremely large and can therefore be limited with max\_subpopulation. If this limit is reached, the subsets are chosen randomly. In a final step, the spatial median (or L1 median) is calculated of all least square solutions.
