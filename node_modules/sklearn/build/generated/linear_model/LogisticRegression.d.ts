/**
  Logistic Regression (aka logit, MaxEnt) classifier.

  In the multiclass case, the training algorithm uses the one-vs-rest (OvR) scheme if the ‘multi\_class’ option is set to ‘ovr’, and uses the cross-entropy loss if the ‘multi\_class’ option is set to ‘multinomial’. (Currently the ‘multinomial’ option is supported only by the ‘lbfgs’, ‘sag’, ‘saga’ and ‘newton-cg’ solvers.)

  This class implements regularized logistic regression using the ‘liblinear’ library, ‘newton-cg’, ‘sag’, ‘saga’ and ‘lbfgs’ solvers. **Note that regularization is applied by default**. It can handle both dense and sparse input. Use C-ordered arrays or CSR matrices containing 64-bit floats for optimal performance; any other input format will be converted (and copied).

  The ‘newton-cg’, ‘sag’, and ‘lbfgs’ solvers support only L2 regularization with primal formulation, or no regularization. The ‘liblinear’ solver supports both L1 and L2 regularization, with a dual formulation only for the L2 penalty. The Elastic-Net regularization is only supported by the ‘saga’ solver.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../linear_model.html#logistic-regression).
