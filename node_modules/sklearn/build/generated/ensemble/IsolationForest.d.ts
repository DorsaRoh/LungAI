/**
  Isolation Forest Algorithm.

  Return the anomaly score of each sample using the IsolationForest algorithm

  The IsolationForest ‘isolates’ observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature.

  Since recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure, the number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path length from the root node to the terminating node.

  This path length, averaged over a forest of such random trees, is a measure of normality and our decision function.

  Random partitioning produces noticeably shorter paths for anomalies. Hence, when a forest of random trees collectively produce shorter path lengths for particular samples, they are highly likely to be anomalies.

  Read more in the [User Guide](../outlier_detection.html#isolation-forest).
