  Gradient Boosting for regression.

  This estimator builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise fashion; it allows for the optimization of arbitrary differentiable loss functions. In each stage a regression tree is fit on the negative gradient of the given loss function.

  [`sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`](sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor "sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor") is a much faster variant of this algorithm for intermediate datasets (`n\_samples >= 10\_000`).

  Read more in the [User Guide](../ensemble.html#gradient-boosting).
