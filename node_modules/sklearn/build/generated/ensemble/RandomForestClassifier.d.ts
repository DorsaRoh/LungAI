/**
  A random forest classifier.

  A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is controlled with the `max\_samples` parameter if `bootstrap=True` (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree.

  For a comparison between tree-based ensemble models see the example [Comparing Random Forests and Histogram Gradient Boosting models](../../auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_hist_grad_boosting_comparison.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-ensemble-plot-forest-hist-grad-boosting-comparison-py).
